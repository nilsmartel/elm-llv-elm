# goals

- strictly keep elm way of duing things
- 100% compliance with elm compiler
    => keep platform independet libraries working under both compilers
    => keep using same language server
    => keep using frontend compiler for error messages

- (if possible) use frontend compiler for error messages and type checking

- easy and sensible ffi
    <= hidden behind subscriptions? => ask expert

## FFI

Language C?

## Testing if elm makes a nice backend language

- Systems Programming,
- Server Programming

e.g.
Write some unix standart bins in elm (yes, echo, ls, pwd, cd, glob, grep).
Write some servers in elm (echo-server, static-file-server, rest-api-server)

What is interesting here:
stdout, stdin, filesystem,
handling requests
